  "text": "Renewable energy comes from natural sources that replenish themselves over time. Unlike fossil fuels such as coal and oil, which take millions of years to form and will eventually run out, renewable energy sources are sustainable and environmentally friendly. The most common types of renewable energy include solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. Solar energy harnesses the power of the sun using solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity. Wind energy uses turbines to capture the kinetic energy of moving air. Hydroelectric power generates electricity from flowing water, typically using dams. Geothermal energy taps into the Earth's internal heat. These renewable sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions, making them crucial in the fight against climate change. Many countries are investing heavily in renewable energy infrastructure to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and create a more sustainable future.",
