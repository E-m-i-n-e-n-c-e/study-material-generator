  "text": "The internet, now an indispensable part of modern life, has a fascinating history that spans several decades. Its origins can be traced back to the 1960s when the United States Department of Defense developed ARPANET, a pioneering network designed to enable multiple computers to communicate on a single network. The first message sent over ARPANET occurred on October 29, 1969, between computers at UCLA and Stanford Research Institute, though the system crashed after transmitting just the first two letters of 'LOGIN'. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, various protocols were developed, including TCP/IP in 1983, which became the standard communication protocol still used today. The term 'Internet' emerged during this period, referring to the interconnection of multiple independent networks. A pivotal moment came in 1989 when British scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web while working at CERN, introducing concepts like HTML, URLs, and HTTP that would make the internet accessible to the general public. The 1990s saw explosive growth as web browsers like Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer brought the internet into homes and businesses worldwide. Today's internet bears little resemblance to its modest beginnings, supporting billions of users and enabling everything from social media to cloud computing, fundamentally transforming how humanity communicates, works, and shares information.",
