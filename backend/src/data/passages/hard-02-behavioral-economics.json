  "text": "Behavioral economics represents a paradigmatic shift from traditional economic theory, integrating psychological insights to understand how people actually make decisions rather than how they should make them according to rational choice theory. Classical economics assumes individuals are rational actors who maximize utility with perfect information and unlimited cognitive capacity. However, decades of research by pioneers like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have revealed systematic deviations from rationality. Prospect theory, one of behavioral economics' cornerstone contributions, demonstrates that people evaluate potential losses and gains asymmetrically—losses loom larger than equivalent gains, a phenomenon known as loss aversion. This finding explains why individuals often reject mathematically favorable bets and why consumers resist switching from default options. Cognitive biases further complicate decision-making: anchoring bias causes people to rely heavily on the first piece of information encountered, while confirmation bias leads to selective interpretation of evidence that supports preexisting beliefs. The availability heuristic makes recent or memorable events seem more probable than statistical reality suggests. These insights have profound implications for policy design, marketing strategies, and financial markets. Nudge theory, developed by Richard Thaler, leverages these behavioral tendencies to guide people toward better choices without restricting options—exemplified by automatic enrollment in retirement savings plans or strategic placement of healthy foods in cafeterias. Behavioral economics has transformed fields from public policy to corporate strategy, revealing that understanding human psychology is crucial for effective economic analysis and intervention design.",
