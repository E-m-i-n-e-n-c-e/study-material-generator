  "title": "The Basics of Supply and Demand",
  "text": "Supply and demand is a fundamental concept in economics. It describes the relationship between the quantity of a commodity that producers wish to sell at various prices and the quantity that consumers wish to buy. The point where the supply and demand curves intersect is known as the equilibrium price. At this price, the quantity of the goods supplied is equal to the quantity of goods demanded. If the price is set too high, an excess supply will be created, leading to a surplus. Conversely, if the price is set too low, demand will outstrip supply, causing a shortage. Understanding this balance is crucial for any market analysis.",
