  "text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This remarkable process occurs primarily in the leaves of plants, where specialized structures called chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, the green pigment that captures sunlight. During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. Using energy from sunlight, they convert these simple molecules into glucose, a type of sugar that serves as food for the plant. Oxygen is released as a byproduct of this process. This oxygen is essential for most life on Earth, as animals and humans depend on it for respiration. Photosynthesis is not only vital for plant growth but also forms the foundation of most food chains on our planet.",
