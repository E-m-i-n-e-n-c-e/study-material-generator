Technical Assessment Brief

Scenario
You are contributing to an AI-powered learning platform. One of the features extracts YouTube transcripts and transforms them into structured study materials for students.
Your challenge is to design and build a standalone component that improves the way transcripts are extracted, processed, and displayed. This test is designed to evaluate your technical depth, problem-solving approach, and ability to deliver under time constraints.

Your Task
Build a component that:
Accepts a YouTube video URL as input.
Extracts the transcript.
Processes the transcript into Enhanced Study Material.
Displays the results in a clean, structured format.
Note: This is a standalone task. You do not need to connect to Blinkgrid’s existing platform. If you require clarification on formatting or user flow, we can provide screenshots of a partially worked version instead of full access.

Required Features
1. Transcript Extraction
Input field for YouTube URL.
Extract transcript using YouTube API or a library.
Handle missing/unavailable transcripts gracefully.
Show loading states during extraction.
2. Content Processing
Transform the raw transcript into Enhanced Study Material:
Divide content into logical sections/topics.
Add clear topic headings.
Highlight key concepts.
Use bullet points for important details.
Provide a summary section.
(Optional) Include timestamps (clickable if possible).
3. Output Format: Enhanced Study Material
Your processed notes should follow this structure:
Example Output Structure
Enhanced Study Material: [Video Title]
Overview
[Brief summary – 2–3 sentences]

Concept 1: [Topic Name]
Timestamp: [00:00]
Main Point 1

Why This Matters: [Explanation]

Concept 2: [Topic Name]
Timestamp: [05:30]
Main Point 1
Main Point 2
Key Takeaway: [Summary]

4. User Interface
Simple, clean input form.
Loading indicator.
Error messages for invalid URLs or failures.
Well-formatted, readable output.
Basic responsive design (desktop + mobile).

Technical Requirements
Tech Stack: Your choice (React, Vue, Vanilla JS for frontend; Node.js/Python backend if needed).
Must Include:
✓ Input validation
✓ Error handling
✓ Loading states
✓ Clean, maintainable code with comments
✓ README with setup instructions
Nice to Have (Bonus Points):
AI/LLM integration to enhance summaries.
Copy-to-clipboard functionality.
Export options (Markdown/PDF).
Customizable summary (length/detail).
Unit tests.
TypeScript.

Constraints
Should run locally (provide setup instructions).
Must work with any public YouTube video with transcripts.
No database or authentication required (stateless component).

Deliverables
Working Code – GitHub repo or ZIP file.
README – including:
Setup instructions
Dependencies
How to run
Notes on API keys (if needed)
Brief Documentation – short write-up (1–2 pages) covering:
Approach taken
Technologies used
Challenges faced
Improvements you’d add with more time
Notes by me -
🔹 How YouTube transcripts work
Official Captions (CC)
Many videos have captions (subtitles) uploaded by the creator or auto-generated by YouTube.
These are stored internally by YouTube and can be fetched programmatically.
Fetching Options
YouTube Data API → does NOT provide transcripts directly. It only gives metadata (title, description, etc.).
Unofficial APIs / scrapers like youtube-transcript-api (Python) or youtubei.js (Node.js). These reverse-engineer YouTube’s internal API to extract transcripts.
yt-dlp (CLI) → can download subtitles in text/SRT format.
Transcript Types
Auto-generated captions (accuracy varies).
Manual subtitles (if uploaded by creator).
Multiple languages may be available.

🔹 Challenges
Not all videos have transcripts.
Some transcripts are segmented (timestamps + text).
Some tools fetch plain text only, while others keep timestamps.
Auto-generated captions may have errors.
